# Real-Time Pixel-Perfect Hard Shadows with Leak Tracing

![](docs/images/TeaserLeakTracing.png)

## Introduction
This repository contains the source code and an interactive demo for [the following EGSR paper:](https://diglib.eg.org/items/d3b40fa5-bbd1-4cf1-8b4f-378e30c9d74f)

This prototype implements Leak Tracing, a hybrid algorithm that combines filterable shadow maps with ray tracing to produce pixel-perfect shadows. Selective ray tracing is employed in regions where filterable shadow maps exhibit light leaks or aliasing. No scene-dependent parameters are required, and the algorithm performs exceptionally well on alpha-tested shadows.

This project was implemented using NVIDIA's Falcor rendering framework. See [README_Falcor.md](README_Falcor.md) for the readme provided with Falcor.

You can download the executable demo from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/TU-Clausthal-Rendering/LeakTracing/releases/latest), or build the project by following the instructions in [Building Falcor](#building-falcor) or the build instructions in the original [readme](README_Falcor.md).

## Demo usage
After downloading the demo from the releases page, you can execute it using the `LeakTracingDemo[SceneName].bat` file. The Bistro and Emerald Square scenes are not included and need to be downloaded separately. After downloading, simply place the entire content of the `.zip` file into the respective subfolder of the `Models` folder (e.g., so that `Models/Bistro/BistroExterior.fbx` exists).
- Bistro: 		https://developer.nvidia.com/orca/amazon-lumberyard-bistro
- Emerald Square: 	https://developer.nvidia.com/orca/nvidia-emerald-square



Controls:
- `WASD` - Camera movement
- `Left Click` + `Mouse movement` - Change camera direction
- `Shift` - Speed up camera movement
- `Q, E` - Camera Down / UP
- `P` - Opens the profiler that shows the Rendertime for each Pass ('ShadowPass' is ours).
- `F9` - Opens the time menu. Animation and camera path speed can be changed here (Scale).
- `F6` - Toggels Graphs UI menu (Enabled by default)

## Testing with more Scenes
Testing with other scenes is possible. The following points should be noted when loading other scenes:
- Load the `LeakTracing` renderscript:
    - Using the `.bat` file (`LeakTracingDemo_NoScene.bat`)
    - Directly in Mogwai with `File->Load Script`. The render pass scripts are in the `scripts` folder (`Data/scripts` in demo).
- A scene can be loaded in Mogwai with `File->Load Scene`.
- Leak Tracing supports analytic point, spot and directional lights, although Point lights were sparingly tested. Leak Tracing theoretically supports up to 42 lights, however, anything above 4 lights was not tested and is considered experimental. 
- The cascaded level points are set automatically depending on the scene bounding box and may need slight manual tweaking (`ShadowMapOptions -> Cascaded Options`).

Falcor supports a variety of scene types:
- Falcor's `.pyscene` format ([more details](docs/usage/scene-formats.md))
    - e.g. [NVIDIA ORCA](https://developer.nvidia.com/orca)
- FBX and GLTF files
    - GLTF files often have very bright lights that may need to be toned down.
- Many PBRT V4 files:
    - e.g. [Benedikt Bitterli's Rendering Resources](https://benedikt-bitterli.me/resources/) or [PBRTv4 scenes repo](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4-scenes)
    - Does not include analytic lights, which need to be added manually in a `.pyscene`

We may add additional `.pyscenes` in the future.

## Falcor Prerequisites
- Windows 10 version 20H2 (October 2020 Update) or newer, OS build revision .789 or newer
- Visual Studio 2022
- [Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0) for Windows 10, version 2004](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
- A GPU which supports DirectX Raytracing, such as the NVIDIA Titan V or GeForce RTX
- NVIDIA driver 466.11 or newer

Optional:
- Windows 10 Graphics Tools. To run DirectX 12 applications with the debug layer enabled, you must install this. There are two ways to install it:
    - Click the Windows button and type `Optional Features`, in the window that opens click `Add a feature` and select `Graphics Tools`.
    - Download an offline package from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit#supplemental-content-for-graphics-media-and-mean-time-between-failures-mtbf-tests). Choose a ZIP file that matches the OS version you are using (not the SDK version used for building Falcor). The ZIP includes a document which explains how to install the graphics tools.
- NVAPI, CUDA, OptiX (see below)

## Building Falcor
Falcor uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org) build system. Additional information on how to use Falcor with CMake is available in the [CMake](docs/development/cmake.md) development documetation page.

### Visual Studio
If you are working with Visual Studio 2022, you can setup a native Visual Studio solution by running `setup_vs2022.bat` after cloning this repository. The solution files are written to `build/windows-vs2022` and the binary output is located in `build/windows-vs2022/bin`.
